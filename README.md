# Forecast_TimeSeries
 Project involves applying different kind of forecasting models

 This project aims to summarize some forecast models, such as :

 - LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory)
 - GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
 - TCN (Temporal Convolution Network)
 - CNN (Convolutional Neuronal Network)
 - MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

 It the end, there will be a brief comparison between models.

 Note: I have been working on updating libraries and function; however, I devoloped this project a long time ago.
