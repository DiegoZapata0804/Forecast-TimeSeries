# Forecast_TimeSeries
 Project about applying different kind of forecast models

 This project tries to summarize some forecast model such as :

 - LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory)
 - GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
 - TCN (Temporal Convolution Network)
 - CNN (Convolutional Neuronal Network)
 - MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

 At the end, a brief comparition between models.

 Note: I have been working on updating libraries and function, however I devoloped it long time ago.
